Bank Tech test
==============

#My approach

This is my submission for the Bank tech test. This implementation has been built
using a TDD design pattern in Ruby. In order to meet the requirements of
the test, I have relied on the following user stories:

```
As a customer,
So that I can put money in my account,
I want to be able to deposit money.

As a customer,
So that I can access my money,
I want to be able to withdraw money.


As a customer,
So that I can keep track of my account activity,
I want to be able to print off an account statement with dated transactions.
```
